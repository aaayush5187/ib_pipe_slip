*Two-fluid nozzle test case, v3*
This case simulates both the internal gas flow in the airblast fuel nozzle using
a single-phase solver, and the atomizing two-phase flow exiting the tip of the nozzle
using a two-phase flow solver. Both solvers are run simultaneously and are one-way
coupled, with the outflow conditions of the internal simulation used as inlet
velocity conditions for the atomization simulation.

The coupling is done manually here, but in the future libraries like preCICE could be used.
