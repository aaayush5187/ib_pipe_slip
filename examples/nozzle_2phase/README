*Two-fluid nozzle test case, v2*
This is a two-phase model of the flow exiting the tip of a canonical airblast fuel nozzle.
The detailed geometry is stair-stepped, based on the `nozzle_internal` case. However, both
a liquid and a gas phase are injected here, allowing atomization to happen downstream.
